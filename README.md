# InventoryProtector
InventoryProtector is a very lightweight plugin that ensures that players whose cause of death was not another player keep their inventory.
This is very useful on survival servers. Many new players quit after being killed by skeletons or other mobs, and this plugin can prevent that.

No configuration is needed, just drag & drop.
